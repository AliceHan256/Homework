# Verifone, Inc.

## Overview and Origin

* Name of Company: 

  Verifone, Inc.

* When was the company incorporated?

  Verifone was founded in 1981.

* Who are the founders of the company?

  William “Bill” Melton.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

  As the publication of Internet Protocol Suite TCP/IP by Cint     Cerf and Bob Kahn in December 1974, the World Wide Web created increasingly high demand for secure online financial transaction applications. In order to reduce losses and fraud risks during processes of commercial transactions, Visa and MasterCard developed automated transaction technology in 1981, with their launched Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) standards. Merchants who newly applied this method were able to get some discount on their transactions as long as the purchasing amount was greater than $50 on all credit cards. This triggered the creation of industry to develop POS authorization systems. Verifone rapidly adapted to this economic environmental change, pioneering in designing and manufacturing POS systems by conforming to the SET standards. By the late 1980s, Verifone had covered more than 60% of the U.S. market, and surpassed half of the global market during the 1990s for such systems.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

  By outsourcing production to minimise its manufacturing and operating costs from the beginning, Verifone launched its first POS system at $500 to the market in 1982. Through working with Visa, Verifone later captured a large share of the POS market. 

  In 1984, Verifone created ZON credit card authorization system and sold it for $125. Verifone’s revenue increased to $15.3 million and it eared a net profit of $864,000 the following year.

  In 1986, Verifone’s revenue doubled to about $30 million.

  By Jan 1988, 53% of POS systems market were occupied by Verifone, and its revenue reached $73.4 million, with a net profit of greater than $6 million.

  In 1989, Verifone acquired Icot Corp., a transaction automation business, expanded its market share to 20.5%. This brought Verifone’s revenue to $125 million, and at the same time, Verifone entered the international market.

  In March 1990, Verifone went public and raised funds for more than $54 million.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

  From 2014 to 2016, personal information loss from merchants due to attacks in the financial services sector was doubled. In addition, there were 64% of retail data disclosure breaches from Point of Sales intrusions. As a result, merchants suffered huge costs not only including the cost of the fraud, cost of investigation for the fraud, remedial costs to become compliant, but also larger cost of reputational damage and loss of customer confidence. 

  Foregenix has identified the top three attack types: Targeted malware, Application Vulnerability Exploits and Structured Query language (SQL)Injection. It has been ever increasingly difficult to deal with the new generation of hackers with extensive and sophisticated IT skills.

  Although PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) helps keeping a high proportion of transactions from base level attacks, there are also a number of challenges for retailers, such as the high costs of PCI and the knowledge of the PCI process needed for everyone. 

  As the leading company in secure payment services and solutions and also sit on the PCI Security Standards Council (SSC), Verifone worked together with Foregenix and some other world’s leading retail brands, preventing retailers’ systems from hackers and malware through a Point-To-Point Encryption (P2PE) solution which backed by PCI audit companies. This eliminates the current risk of credit card data compromise and reduces the cost of PCI compliance assessment and validation.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
